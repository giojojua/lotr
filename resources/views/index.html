        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set
            in Middle-earth, intended to be Earth at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to
            Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in
            stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over
            150 million copies sold.
            <br><br>
            The title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One
            Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of
            Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the
            story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the
            hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.
            <br><br>
            Although often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along
            with The Silmarillion. For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published over the course of
            a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955, in three volumes titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The
            Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with
            several appendices of background material. Some later editions print the entire work in a single volume,
            following the author's original intent.
            <br><br>
            Tolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of
            extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord
            of the Rings, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in
            the First World War.
            <br><br>
            The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. The
            enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding
            of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his
            works. It has inspired numerous derivative works, including artwork, music, films, television, video games,
            and board games, helping create and shape the modern fantasy genre, within which it is considered one of the
            greatest books of all time.
            <br><br>
            Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It has been
            named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read.</p>
